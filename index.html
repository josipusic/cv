                Hello Josip. We would like to know more about your work experience.
                Could you describe us in short what are you doing in your current job?
            </p><br><br>
            <span class="dialogue-member">Josip:</span>
            <p class="qna">
                Hello. I am self-employed, and I'm currently collaborating with Belgium
                telecom TelSmart (Switch Cloud) as a backend lead developer.<br>There is a client side application that
                is used by TelSmart's customers, and I am developing backend for that application. I am using
                Django Rest Framework for that purpose. All APIs are tested with unit and integration tests and
                documented using Swagger.<br>There is also application written with Django admin used by TelSmart's
                employees, and is mostly used as a client support portal.<br>As any other software, these applications
                are constantly evolving, and I am involved in planning and coding of new features. I fix bugs and
                refactor existing code.<br>I do code reviews and mentor junior developers.<br>I am involved in setting
                up
                and maintaining AWS infrastructure with aws cdk.
            </p><br><br>

            <span class="dialogue-member">Interviewer:</span>
            <p class="qna">
                Could you tell us more about the last feature you have developed?
            </p><br><br>
            <span class="dialogue-member">Josip:</span>
            <p class="qna">
                Certainly! I worked on a phonebook uploader feature. Feature was already developed, but was tightly
                coupled with the rest of the Django application and needed to be refactored.<br>When user uploads a file
                it is stored in AWS S3 bucket. Processing lambda function is triggered to validate the data.
                Data processing is done with pandas library. After data is validated, it is stored in PostgreSQL table
                which is partitioned by file that is uploaded. User can see processed data and modify it if needed.
                After user modifies the data, another lambda function is triggered to validate data again. This process
                is iterative. When user is satisfied, data is saved to permanent table and the processed partitioned
                table is destroyed.<br>This way web server is decoupled from the data upload and processing.
            </p><br><br>

            <span class="dialogue-member">Interviewer:</span>
            <p class="qna">
                What was the biggest challenge you have faced while developing this feature?
            </p><br><br>
            <span class="dialogue-member">Josip:</span>
            <p class="qna">
                The biggest challenge was to put all the pieces together since multiple AWS services were involved.
            </p><br><br>

            <span class="dialogue-member">Interviewer:</span>
            <p class="qna">
                Did you work on any other features? If yes, could you tell us briefly about them?
            </p><br><br>
            <span class="dialogue-member">Josip:</span>
            <p class="qna">
                I worked on many interesting features. One I'm proud of is creating a permission system from scratch.
                Company needed a permission system that is flexible and easy to use. I developed a row level permissions
                (ACL) where each user can have different permissions for each row in the database. It was a framework on
                its
                own, and it was a great challenge to create it especially the part with data migrations.<br>
                Some other interesting features i planned and developed are creating generic framework for integrating
                into third party APIs using webhooks, creating interactive voice response system (IVR) where client can
                request a text to be recorded from professional voice actors, creating a text to speech system (TTS)
                where client can request a text to be converted to speech using AWS Polly, AZURE and Google TTS APIs,
                and many more.

            <span class="dialogue-member">Interviewer:</span>
            <p class="qna">
                While developing these features, did you manage infrastructure as well?

            <span class="dialogue-member">Josip:</span>
            <p class="qna">
                Yes, I did. I used aws Python cdk to create and maintain infrastructure.
            </p><br><br>

            <span class="dialogue-member">Interviewer:</span>
            <p class="qna">
                Did you manage infrastructure in other companies you worked for?

            <span class="dialogue-member">Josip:</span>
            <p class="qna">
                Yes, I used custom servers to deploy applications, and I used docker to containerize them.
                I also used Docker Swarm to manage services across multiple servers and I did the setting up of
                GitLab CI pipelines.

            <span class="dialogue-member">Interviewer:</span>

                Site is deployed on DigitalOcean droplet. I used nginx server.

            <span class="dialogue-member">Interviewer:</span>
            <p class="qna">
                Do you consider yourself full stack developer or a backend developer?
                If full stack, do you prefer one over the other?
            </p><br><br>
            <span class="dialogue-member">Josip:</span>
            <p class="qna">
                I am more inclined towards backend development so i do prefer it, but I am also familiar with frontend
                development.
            </p><br><br>

            <span class="dialogue-member">Interviewer:</span>
            <p class="qna">
                What kind of business relationship do you prefer? B2B or employment?

            <span class="dialogue-member">Josip:</span>
            <p class="qna">
                I prefer B2B relationship, but I am open to employment as well.

            <span class="dialogue-member">Interviewer:</span>
            <p class="qna">
                What would be the compensation you would expect?

            <span class="dialogue-member">Josip:</span>
            <p class="qna">
                That is a subject for negotiation, but I would expect a compensation that is in line with my experience.
            </p><br><br>

            <span class="dialogue-member">Interviewer:</span>
            <p class="qna">
                As a next step, we would like to give you a task to see how you would approach it.
                Are you willing to do it?
            </p><br><br>
            <span class="dialogue-member">Josip:</span>
            <p class="qna">
                Unfortunately no, but I would gladly point You to my toy repo on GitHub like
